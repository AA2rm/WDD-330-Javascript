            <h2>Forms</h2>
            Each form control has an initial value that can be specified in the HTML code. This value can be changed by
            a user entering information or interacting with the form’s interface, (such as using a slider to increase or
            decrease a value). The value can also be changed dynamically using JavaScript.<br>

         
                <form name='search' action='/search'>
                    <!--name attribute 'search'-->
                    <input name='searchInput'>
                    <!--input field & a 'searchInput' attribute-->
                    <button type='submit'>Search</button>
                </form>
            

            <b>document.forms</b> returns an HTML collection of all the forms in the document in the order they appear
            in the markup. A form object also has a method called elements that returns an HTML collection of all the 
            elements contained in the form. We can also access the form controls using their 'name' attributes as if it 
            was a property of the form object, you can also use the square bracket notation can also be used instead.<br>

            <h2>Form Properties & Method</h2><br>
            The form.submit() method will submit the form automatically. A form can be submitted manually by the user
            employing a button or input element with a type attribute of submit , or even an input element with a type 
            attribute of image. While the <b>form.reset</b> method will reset all the form controls back to their initial 
            ues specified in the HTML. A button with a type attribute of reset can also be used to do this without the need 
            for additional scripting. The <b>form.action</b> property can be used to set the action attribute of a form, so 
            it’s sent to a different URL to be processed on the server.<br>

            <h2>Form Events</h2><br>
            Forms trigger a number of events; the <b>focus</b> event occurs when an element is focused on. In the case
            of an <b>input</b> element, this is when the cursor is placed inside the element.<br>

            <h2>Submitting Forms</h2><br>
            The most important form event is the submit event, occurring when the form is submitted. Usually this will
            send the content of the form to the server to be processed, but we can use JavaScript to intercept the form 
            before it’s sent by adding a <b>submit</b> listener.<br>

            <h2>Retrieving & Changing Values from a Form</h2>
            Text input elemtnt ojbs have <b>value</b> property that can be used to retrieve text from inside the field.
            The <b>input</b> points to the input element in the form. You can also set the value using JS using the input.value. 
            The <b>placeholder</b> attribute can do this as well.<br>

            <h2>Form Control</h2><br>
            Some common types of form control are: <b>input</b>, <b>select</b>, <b>textarea</b>, & <b>buttton</b>,
            <b>autofocus</b>. The <b>placeholder</b> attribute will insert the value provided in the input field until the user 
            enters some text. The <b>maxlength</b> attribute will limit the number of characters that can be entered in the field 
            the value given. Here's a reference for new form elements.<br>

           
            <div class="sitepoint">Here's a complete array reference<a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/html5-forms-markup/">
                Sitepoint</a>
            </div>
          

            <h2>Input Fields</h2><br>
            There are several categories of input field. The default type of input field is <b>text</b> which is used
            for entering a short piece of text, such as a username. It's advise to use the <b>type='text</b> attribute
             making the input field explicit. You set  this in the HTML using the <b>value</b> attribute.<br>

            <code>
                <label for='donation-amount'>Enter amount to donate:
                    <input type='text' id='donation-amount' name='donationAmount' value='10'>
                </label>
            </code><br>

            Other input fields are <b>intput type='password'</b>, <b>type='checkbox'</b>, <b>type'radio</b>, <b>type='hidden'</b>,
            <b>typ'file/</b>, <b>type='number'</b>, <b>type='tel'</b>, and <b>type='color'</b>. We can assign a <b>category</b>property
            to our objects, like hero.<br>
            
            <h2>Drop Down List Selection</h2><br>
            This lets you select one or more options from a list.<br>

            <h2>Text Areas</h2><br>
            A <b>textarea</b> element is used to enter long pieces of text over multiple lines such as a comment or blog post.<br>

            <h2>Buttons</h2><br>
            The <b>submit</b> button is the default for most forms, but you can also use <b>reset</b>, <b>click me</b>, <b>menu</b>,
            <b>menuitem</b>, & <b>li</b>You can also disable the submit button.<br>
            
            <b>Validating Forms</b><br>
            Form validation is the process of checking whether a user has entered the information into a form correctly. Examples of the 
            types of validation that occur include ensuring that: A required field is completed, An email address is valid, A number is 
            entered when numerical data is required, & A password is at least a minimum number of characters. Validation can occur on the 
            client side using JavaScript, and on the server side.<br>

            <h2 >Object Oriented Programming</h2><br>
            <h3>An introduction to OOP</h3><br>
            There are 3 main concepts in OOP 
            <b>encapsulation</b>-are the inner working that are kept hidden inside the obj, while the essential functionalities are exposed.
            <b>polymorphism</b>-various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more 
            specific implementation.
            <b>inheritance </b>-this means we can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then 
            improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.

            Many object-oriented languages, such as Java and Ruby, are known asclass-basedlanguages. This is because they use a class to define 
            a blueprint for an object. Objects are then created as an instance of that class, and inherit all the properties and methods of the class.<br>

            <h3>Constructor functions.</h3><br>
            An alternative way to create objects is to use aconstructor function. This is a function that defines the properties and methods
            of an object. When instantiating a new obj the parentheses are required, however, if any default arguments need to be provided.<br>
            <code>
                const whiteDice = new Dice(4);
            </code><br>
            
            To validate the obj is assign to the var:
            <code>
                redDice instanceof Dice
                true
            </code><br>

            JS contains a number of built-in constructor functions such as <b>object</b>, <b>array</b>, & <b>function</b> that can be used to create 
            objects, arrays and functions instead of literals.
