            <h1>Wk 4 Notes</h1>(Pg. 303-321)
            <h2>Forms</h2>
            Forms are made up of a <b>form</b> element that contains form controls such as input fields, select menus
            and
            buttons. Each form control has an initial value that can be specified in the HTML code. This value can be
            changed by a user entering information or interacting with the form’s interface, (such as using a slider to
            increase or decrease a value). The value can also be changed dynamically using JavaScript.<br>

            Ex: A form with one input filed, & a button to submit a searh query
            <form name='search' action='/search'>
                <!--name attribute 'search'-->
                <input name='searchInput'>
                <!--input field & a 'searchInput' attribute-->
                <button type='submit'>Search</button>
            </form>


            <b>document.forms</b> returns an HTML collection of all the forms in the document in the order they appear
            in the markup. A form object also has a method called elements that returns an HTML collection of all the
            elements contained in the form. We can also access the form controls using their 'name' attributes as if it
            was a property of the form object, you can also use the square bracket notation can also be used
            instead.<br>

            <h2>Form Properties & Method</h2>
            The form.submit() method will submit the form automatically. A form can be submitted manually by the user
            employing a button or input element with a type attribute of submit , or even an input element with a type
            attribute of image. While the <b>form.reset</b> method will reset all the form controls back to their
            initial
            ues specified in the HTML. A button with a type attribute of reset can also be used to do this without the
            need
            for additional scripting. The <b>form.action</b> property can be used to set the action attribute of a form,
            so
            it’s sent to a different URL to be processed on the server.<br>

            <h2>Form Events</h2>
            Forms trigger a number of events; the <b>focus</b> event occurs when an element is focused on. In the case
            of an <b>input</b> element, this is when the cursor is placed inside the element.<br>

            <h2>Submitting Forms</h2>
            The most important form event is the submit event, occurring when the form is submitted. Usually this will
            send the content of the form to the server to be processed, but we can use JavaScript to intercept the form
            before it’s sent by adding a <b>submit</b> listener.<br>

            <h2>Retrieving & Changing Values from a Form</h2>
            Text input elemtnt ojbs have <b>value</b> property that can be used to retrieve text from inside the field.
            The <b>input</b> points to the input element in the form. You can also set the value using JS using the
            input.value.
            The <b>placeholder</b> attribute can do this as well.<br>

            <h2>Form Control</h2>
            Some common types of form control are: <b>input</b>, <b>select</b>, <b>textarea</b>, & <b>buttton</b>,
            <b>autofocus</b>. The <b>placeholder</b> attribute will insert the value provided in the input field until
            the user
            enters some text. The <b>maxlength</b> attribute will limit the number of characters that can be entered in
            the field
            the value given. Here's a reference for new form elements.<br>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/html5-forms-markup/" title="Site Point Forms">Form Markup</a>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Input Fields</h2>(Pg. 317)
            There are several categories of input field. The default type of input field is <b>text</b> which is used
            for entering a short piece of text, such as a username. It's advise to use the <b>type='text</b> attribute
            making the input field explicit. You set this in the HTML using the <b>value</b> attribute.<br>

            <code>
                <label for='donation-amount'>Enter amount to donate:
                    <input type='text' id='donation-amount' name='donationAmount' value='10'>
                </label>
            </code><br>

            Other input fields are <b>intput type='password'</b>, <b>type='checkbox'</b>, <b>type'radio</b>,
            <b>type='hidden'</b>,
            <code>
                <label for='realName'>Real Name:
                    <input type='password' name='realName' id='realName'></label>
            </code>

            <b>typ'file/</b>, <b>type='number'</b>, <b>type='tel'</b>, and <b>type='color'</b>. We can assign a
            <b>category</b>property
            to our objects, like hero.<br>

            <h2>Drop Down List Selection</h2>
            This lets you select one or more options from a list.<br>

            <h2>Text Areas</h2>
            A <b>textarea</b> element is used to enter long pieces of text over multiple lines such as a comment or blog
            post.<br>

            <h2>Buttons</h2>
            The <b>submit</b> button is the default for most forms, but you can also use <b>reset</b>, <b>click me</b>,
            <b>menu</b>,
            <b>menuitem</b>, & <b>li</b>You can also disable the submit button.<br>

            <b>Validating Forms</b>
            Form validation is the process of checking whether a user has entered the information into a form correctly.
            Validation can occur on the
            client side using JavaScript, and on the server side.Examples of the types of validation that occur include
            ensuring that: A required
            field is completed, An email address is valid, A number is entered when numerical data is required, & A
            password is at least a minimum
            number of characters. Validation can occur on the client side using JavaScript, and on the server side.<br>

            <b>API</b> works by simply adding relevant attributes to the form fields. For example, if a field is a
            required field that must be filled in, all
            you need to do is add a required attribute to that field and the browser will take care of the rest.<br>

            <h2>Chapter 12-Object Oriented Programming</h2>(Pg 457)
            <h3>An introduction to OOP</h3>
            There are 3 main concepts in OOP
            <b>encapsulation</b>-are the inner working that are kept hidden inside the obj, while the essential
            functionalities are exposed.
            <b>polymorphism</b>-various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared
            methods with a more
            specific implementation. <b>Inheritance </b>-this means we can take an object that already exists and
            inherit all its properties and methods.
            We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.<br>

            Many object-oriented languages, such as Java and Ruby, are known asclass-basedlanguages. This is because
            they use a class to define
            a blueprint for an object. Objects are then created as an instance of that class, and inherit all the
            properties and methods of the class.<br>

            <h3>Constructor functions.</h3>
            An alternative way to create objects is to use aconstructor function. This is a function that defines the
            properties and methods of an object.
            When instantiating a new obj the parentheses are required, however, if any default arguments need to be
            provided. The keyword this is used to
            represent the object that will be returned by the constructor function.(ex. in main.js wk 12)<br>


            JS contains a number of built-in constructor functions such as <b>object</b>, <b>array</b>, &
            <b>function</b> that can be used to create
            objects, arrays and functions instead of literals.

            <h3>Inheritance</h3>
            <b>Inheritance</b> is taking the features of one object then adding some new & inheritance: taking the
            features of one object then adding some new
            features.<br>

            <h3>classes in JavaScript</h3>
            <b>Classes</b> in JavaScript use a class to define a blueprint for an object. Objects are then created as an
            instance of that class, and inherit
            all the properties and methods of the class.

            <h3>Constructor Functions</h3>(Pg. 459)
            This is a function that defines the properties and methods of an object. Here is the dice example rewritten
            as a constructor function JavaScript
            contains a number of built-in constructor functions such as Object, Array, and Function that can be used to
            create objects, arrays and functions
            instead of literals. Array constructor functions exhibit some strange behavior regarding the arguments
            supplied, however. If only one argument is
            given, it doesn’t create an array with that argument as the first element, as you might expect. It sets the
            array’s length property instead, and
            returns an array full of undefined! This results in an error being thrown if a floating point decimal number
            is provided as an argument, because
            the length of an array must be an integer.<br>

            <h3>ES6 Class Declarations</h3>(Pg. 464)
            ES6 introduced the new class declaration syntax that does exactly the same thing as a constructor function,
            but looks much similar to writing a
            class in a classbased programming language. The names of constructor functions or class declarations are
            capitalized. Once the new instance is
            created, the class behaves the same way as the obj.<br>

            <h3>Constructor Property</h3>
            <b>Constructor property</b> returns the constructor func that created it. When an object literal is used to
            create a new object, we can see that in
            the background, the Object constructor function is being used. We can use the constructor property to
            instantiate a copy of an object, without having
            to reference the actual constructor function or class declaration directly.<br>



            <h3>Static Methods</h3>
            The static keyword can be used in class declarations to create a static method (class methods). Static
            methods are not available to instances of the
            class.<br>


            <h3>Prototypal Inheritance</h3>(Pg. 467)
            Every class has a prototype property that is shared by every instance of the class. So any properties or
            methods of a class’s prototype can be accessed
            by every object instantiated by that class. <br>


            <h3>Prototype Property</h3>
            The <b>prototype property</b> allow you to add arguments the class with extra methods and properties after
            it has been created. This is useful when you
            don't have ccess to the class declaration. All instances of the the Turtle class share all the properties
            and methods of its prototype. This means they
            can call any methods of the prototype and access any of its properties. Now if we create a new instance, we
            can see that it inherits the property and
            method from the object, as well as receiving the property name and method from the class declaration.<br>


            <h3>Finding Out the Prototype</h3>
            There are a number of ways to find the prototype of an object, by the constructor functions's prototype
            property, the Object.getPrototypeOf() method, the
            and by the dudnder proto(short for double underscore proto).<br>




            <h3>Prototypes</h3> JavaScript didn’t have classes before ES6, and used the concept of using actual objects
            as the blueprint for creating more objects.
            The class declaration syntax works in exactly the same way as the constructor function syntax, while
            avoiding the pitfalls of using a const func.



            <h3>Public and private methods</h3>

            <h3>Public and private methods</h3>
