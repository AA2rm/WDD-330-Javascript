            <h3>Forms</h3>
            Each form control has an initial value that can be specified in the HTML code. This value can be changed by
            a user
            entering information or interacting with the form’s interface (such as using a slider to increase or
            decrease a value). The value can also be changed dynamically using JavaScript.
            <code>
                form name='search' action='/search'>
                <!--name attribute 'search'-->
                input name='searchInput'>
                <!--input field & a 'searchInput' attribute-->
                button type='submit'>Search/button>
                /form>
            </code>
            <b>document.forms</b> returns an HTML collection of all the forms in the document in the order they appear
            in the markup.
            A form object also has a method called elements that returns an HTML collection of all the elements
            contained in the form.
            We can also access the form controls using their 'name' attributes as if it was a property of the form
            object, you can also
            use the square bracket notation can also be used instead.<br>

            <h3>Form Properties & Method</h3><br>
            The form.submit() method will submit the form automatically. A form can be submitted manually by the user employing 
            a button or input element with a type attribute of submit , or even an input element with a type attribute of image.
            While the <b>form.reset</b> method will reset all the form controls back to their initial values specified in the HTML.
            A button with a type attribute of reset can also be used to do this without the need for additional scripting. The 
            <b>form.action</b> property can be used to set the action attribute of a form, so it’s sent to a different URL to be 
            processed on the server.<br>

            <h3 >Form Events</h3><br>
            Forms trigger a number of events; the <b>focus</b> event occurs when an element is focused on. In the case of an 
            <b>input</b>> element, this is when the cursor is placed inside the element.
