        <h3>JavaScript grammar ― expressions, statements, semicolons and whitespace</h3>
        JS programs use multiple statements, ending w/ a new line or semicolon. Ex pg. 52
        nessary to add a ( ; ) to end a statement because JS uses ASI that can place
        ( ; ) @ the end for you. This can however be error prone and prevent minifies &
        validator to not work. It’s best practice to write ea. Statement on a new line.
        <br>
        Block statements in curly brackets; don’t have to be terminated by ( ; )
        White spaces separate various part of ea. Statement.
        Reserved words for JS pg. 53 avoid naming var or files w/ these.
        <br>
        <h3>Primitive data types</h3>
        JS has 6 primitive data type: Strings, Numbers, Symbols, Boolean, Undefined, & Null.
        JS also has 1 object type which includes: Arrays, Functions, & Object literals.
        JS special operator (typeof) is used for finding the value type (pg 36)
        Operators apply an operation to a value known as operand A unary operator requires 1
        operand, while a binary operator requires 2 operands. A ternary operator requires 3
        operands. There are 3 string vars : string literals, string properties and methods
        <br>
        <h3>Declaring and assigning constants and variables</h3>
        Variables refer to a stored value. You must declare a var first b4 it can be used. Key words
        like (const) & (let) are used to declare var. const is used when a var will not be reassigned
        another value. It’s best practice to use a const var let is use the value might be reassigned
        later. Assign a value w/ the (=) operator.
        <span style="color:red;font-size:17px"><b>Q:</b> What is ES6?</span>
        <br>
        <h3>You can declare a var and assign string names</h3>
        Along w/ string names you can assign multiple comma-deliberated variables at the same time.
        If a var refences a <b>non-primitve data type</b> array, function, or object the data w/in
        the object can change to a mutating object & mutated later. The var behavior has to remain
        consistent.
        <br>
        <h4>Scopes</h4>
        Using <b>const</b> & <b>let </b>to declare var means they are block scoped. Their values only
        exists inside the blocks. There are 2 types of scopes, global & local. Global scopes are var declard
        outside of a block making it accessible throuhout the program. This is <i>NOT GOOD PRACTICE</i>. local
        scope are var inside a block, & uses the let or const are only available inside the block it's created
        in. However, it let or const are not used then the var are considered global scopes & are available
        outside of the block. Both const & let are defined inside the block (pg. 43)

        <br>
        <h3>Naming Constants & Variables</h3>
        Name var that describe what the var represent. They can start w/ upper & lower case letters, an underscore,
        or a dollar character, as well as contain numbers, as long as they don't start w/ numbers. Avoid using
        underscors
        and dollar sign at the beginning of your named var, it can cause problems. Constant & var are case
        sensitive. If
        using multiple words to name your var follow these rules.
        <p class="tab">Example of a  tab</p>
        <b>Camel case </b> starts w/ lowercase & ea. new word is capitalized.
        firstNameAndLastName
        <b>Underscore</b>separates ea. new word w/ an underscore.
        first_name_and_last_name
        <br>
        <h3>Direct Assignment & Assignment By Reference(pg. 45-</h3>
        Assign a <b>non-primitive value</b> to a var using a <b>reference</b> keyword(pg 45)
        <b>Strings</b> are a grp. of letters & symbols.
        Create a string obj using a <b>constructor function</b> (pg 46)
        Using single & double quotes, & apostrophes in your string (pg. 46) 
        You can use <b>backlashes</b> to escape using quotation marks. (pg. 46-47)
        <b>Properties</b> are info abt the obj or value. While <b>methods</b>> are perform an action on an obj.
        or value. A method is an action that a primitive data type or obj can perform, using the (.) operator
        followed by the name of the method, followed by () (pg. 49)
        <b>Wrapper obj</b> (pg. 47)
        <br>
        <h3>Good Habits</h3>(pg.48-51)
        A <b>dot notation</b> can give you the string length property.
        Another method to access a primitive data type are <b>square brackets</b>
        
        <b>charAt</b>character positioning(pg. 49 )
        <b>indexOf</b> method tells you where a character or substring appeares in a string.
        <b>lastIndexOf</b> tells you the last occurence of a char or substring.
        <b>includes</b> method tells you what a string of certain char are.
        <b>startWith()</b>lets you chk if a string start w/ a certain char.
        <b>endWith</b>method lets you chk if a string ends w/ a particular char.
        <b>concat()</b>
        <b>+'',''</b>concantenation shortcut
        <b>trim()</b> method remove white space
        <b>repeat()</b> method repeats a string
        <br>
        <h3>Template Literals</h3>(pg. 52-53)
        A special type of string (ES6) use the backtick char. that use string interpolation.
        <br>
        <h3>Symbol</h3>(pg. 53-55)
        A primitive value to avoid naming collisions using the symbol function.
        Symbol()
        <br>
        <h3>Numbers ― decimal, hexadecimal, octal, binary and exponent form, Infinity, and NaN</h3> (pg55-64)
        Number can be <b>intergers</b> whichare whole numbers or <b>floating point numbrs</b> which are decimals or
        floats.
        Numbers have a constructor function.
        <b>Octal & hexadecimal numbers</b> starts w/ an "ox" is a hexadecial (bse 16) notation.
        <b>Exponential Numbers</b> use the exponential or scientific notation.
        <b>Number methods</b> have built-in methods; write this w/ an <b>toExpoential</b> method when working w/
        number
        literals that are intergers.
        <br>
        <h3>Arithmetic operations(Converting btn Strings & Numbers) such as +, -, *, /, and %</h3>(pg.59-60)
        You can do the followring in arithemtic operations
        <p class="tab">Example of a  tab</p>
        change the value of a var using a <b>compound assignment operator, +=;</b>
        <p><b>Increment values</b> with a ++
        Incorporate the <b>infinity</b> to represent large numbers
        Use a <b>Nan</b> to express a value is not a number.
        Chk a value is a number using the <b>Number</b>.isFinite() metho
        Use a <b>type coercion</b> to show different types of an operand oprator.
        You can parse numbers using the <b>parseInt()</b> function.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Undefined and null</h3>(pg. 69)
        Use an <b>Undefined</b> to express when a var is not assignmed to a value.
        Use a <b>Null</b> as a placeholder to express that there is no value.
        <br>Undefined and null
        <h3>Booleans ― truthy and falsy values</h3>(pg. 70)
        This just mean that a logical statement value is either true or false.
        <br>
        <h3>Logical operators ― AND, OR, and NOT</h3>(pg.71)
        <b>Logical operators</b> can be used w/ any primitive value or obj & the results are based on if the values
        are true or false.
        <b>!(Logical Not)</b> will convert a statement into a Boolean and return the <b>opposite value</b> known as
        negation.
        <b>&t&t(Logical And)</b> works on 2 or more values and the value is only true if <b>all</b> the operands are
        true.
        A <b>II (Logical OR)</b> works on 2 or more values/operands and is true if 1 of the operands are true.

        <b>Bitwise operators</b>(pg.75-78)
        <b>Bitwise Not</b>

    CHAPTER 3
    <h3>Array literals</h3>
    To retrieve a specific value in an aray, we write its position in the [] sq bracket called the index.(pg. 90)
    To <b>add values</b> to an array, place the string in the element. The index <b>notation </b> is used to add
    new items to a position w/in the index. Unused slots in the index have an <b>undefined</b> value. To
    <b>remove</b> a
    value from an array literal use the <b>delete</b> operator.

    <h3>Arrays</h3>
    An array is an ordered list of values. To create an array literal, simply write a pair
of square brackets:

        <input type="text" id="text1" name="Enter first number"><br>
        <input type="text" id="text2" name="Enter second number"><br>
        Result: <br>
        <input type="text" id="txtresult" placeholder="TextBox3"><br>

        CHAPTER 4
        (Passing the Argument)
        A callback function is passed as an argument into another function. It contains a 
        string of code. You call the function by naming it, & it's followed by ( ), this
        tells the function to execute the code in thee ( ).
        The argument consist of a method that has an event(onclick) & a function of (whatToDo).
        The addEventListener method executes the function only when an event occurs.
