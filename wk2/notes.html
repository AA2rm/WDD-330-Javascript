            <h1>Learning Javascript</h1>
            <h2>CHAPTER 1: Programming (PGS. 1-33)</h2><br>

            <b>Low-level programming language</b> programs written in <b>machine code</b> & <b>assembly
                language</b>.<br>
            <b>High-level programming language</b> allows abstractions to be used & uses programming language that's
            compiled into machine code & executed.(very fast)<br>
            <b>Scripting languages </b> are also high-level & are translated into machine code at run time, making them
            slower than compiled language.<br>
            <b>Ajax</b> is the technique of getting data from a server in the background & updating only the relevant
            parts of the web page w/o the need for a full page reload.<br>

            <h3>Node.js</h3>
            Install node.js using the installer or Nover Version Manager. You can also install node.js using command
            lines<br>
            STEP 1 Install build tools
            For MAC<br>
            Install the X code command line tools by running the following command:
            xcode-select --install<br>
            For WINDOWS<br>
            If you’re using Linux, you’ll need to install the “build-essential” package. This can be done by running the
            following commands on Debian-based distros (use your package manager of choice with other distros):
            sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install build-essential<br>

            STEP 2 Install nvm<br>
            To install nvm, simply run the following <u>command:</u><br>
            curl -o-
            ➥ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.0/

            Now that nvm is installed, you’ll need to reload your shell, before you can install Node. This can be done
            using the following command in:<br>

            Mac Os<br>
            . ~/.bash_profile<br>

            Or by using the following command:<br>

            Linux<br>
            . ~/.bashrc

            Now you can install the latest version of Node with the following command:<br>
            nvm install node<br>

            You might have to wait a while for everything to download and install, but once it’s finished, you can check
            everything is working properly by entering the following command:<br>

            node -v<br>
            It will return the version number of Node that is installed

            <h3>JS in the console</h3><br>

            1. If you installed Node, you can use the REPL, which stands for Read Eval Print Loop. It allows you to
            write JavaScript in the console then outputs the results. To start the REPL,
            all you need to do is open up a terminal prompt and enter the command node. This should then display a
            prompt. To exit the REPL, simply hold the ctrl key and hit C twice.<br>

            2. Another option is to use the JavaScript console that comes with your browser.
            You can access the console by opening your browser and pressing F12 (or Command + Option + I on a Mac) to
            open the developer tools then clicking on the Console tab.<br>

            3. The last option is to use the E66 Console website. This allows you to enter JavaScript commands directly
            into the browser and see the results. It also lets you write in ES6 and see what it looks like after it has
            been transpiled into ES5.<br>

            <code>
                <button onclick="loadProgram()">Load Program</button>
            </code>

            <h3>JavaScript grammar:</h3>
            There’s no need to actually use a (;)to terminate
            a statement because JavaScript interpreters use a process called Automatic
            Semicolon Insertion (ASI). This will attempt to place semicolons at the end of
            lines for you. However, it can be error-prone and cause a number of automated
            services such as code minifiers and validators to not work properly.It’s <b>best
                practice</b> to write ea. Statement on a new line w/ a (;) at the end.(pg. 35 Javascript: Novice to
            Ninja, 2nd ed)
            <br>

            <h3>Block statements</h3>
            Reside in curly brackets; don’t have to be terminated by ( ; )

            <h3>White spaces</h3>
            Separates various parts of a syntax statement.

            <h3>Reserved words</h3>
            For JS (pg. 53 Javascript: Novice to Ninja,2nd ed) avoid naming var or files w/ these.<br>

            <h3>Primitive data types</h3>
            JS has 6 <b>rimitive data type:</b> Strings, Numbers, Symbols, Boolean, Undefined, & Null & any value that's
            not a primative data type is an <b>object</b>.
            JS also has 1 object type which includes: Arrays, Functions, & Object literals.
            JS special operator (typeof) is used for finding the value type (pg 36)
            Operators apply an operation to a value known as operand. The <b>operator</b> can be a type of such as: =, +
            , %, * and an operand can be: a boolean, number,
            true or false.<br>
            <ol>
                <li>An operand A unary operator requires 1 operand</li>
                <li>While a binary operator requires 2 operands.</li>
                <li>A ternary operator requires 3</li>
            </ol>

            operands. There are 3 string vars : string literals, string properties and methods


            <h3>Variables</h3><br>
            Variables refer to a stored value.
            <u>How to Declare & Assign Variables</u><br>
            1. Declare a var- Use a Keyword <b>const</b>when the var WILL NOT be reassigned to another value.<br>
            2. Declar a var- Use the keyword <b>let</b> if the var will be reassigned later.<br>
            3. Assign a value w/ the (=) operator. (Ex.wk2/main.js lines 3-).<br>
            4. To see the value of a variable, simply enter it in the console and press enter.<br>

            <span style="color:red;font-size:17px">
                <b>Q:</b> What is ES6?<br>
                <b>A:</b>ES6 is ECMAScript 6. It is a JavaScript standard meant to ensure the interoperability of Web
                pages across different Web browsers.<br>
            </span>

            <h3>Declare & Assign Multiple String Names</h3>
            You can assign multiple comma-deliberated variables at the same time.<br>
            <ul>
                <li>If a variable is assigned to a primitive data type, then the value can’t be changed, and will result
                    in an error.</li>
                <li>If a var refences a <b>non-primitve data type</b> array, function, or object the data w/in
                    the object can change to a mutating object & mutated later. The var behavior has to remain
                    <u> consistent.</u></li>
            </ul>
            (Ex. pg 58)<br>

            <h3>Scopes</h3><br>
            Using <b>const</b> & <b>let </b>to declare var means they are block scoped. Their values only
            exists inside the blocks, & has two types of scopes, <b>lobal & local</b>. Global scopes are var declard
            outside of a block making it accessible throuhout the program. This is <i>NOT GOOD PRACTICE</i>. Local
            scope are vars inside a block, & uses the let or const are only available inside the block it's created
            in. However, <u>if let or const are not used then the var are considered global scopes & are available
                outside of the block</u>. Both const & let are defined inside the block (pg. 60)<br>

            <h3>Naming Constants & Variables</h3>
            Name var that describe what the var represent. They can start w/ upper & lower case letters, an underscore,
            or a dollar character, as well as contain numbers, as long as they don't start w/ numbers. Avoid using
            underscors and dollar sign at the beginning of your named var, it can cause problems. Constant & var are
            case sensitive. If using multiple words to name your var follow these rules.<br>

            <b>camelCase</b> starts w/ lowercase & ea. new word is capitalized.<br>
            firstNameAndLastName<br>
            <b>Underscore</b>separates ea. new word w/ an underscore.<br>
            first_name_and_last_name. If a var refences a <b>non-primitve data type</b> array, function, or object the
            data w/in
            the object can change to a mutating object & mutated later. The var behavior has to remain
            consistent.<br>

            <h3>Direct Assignment & Assignment By Reference(pg. 63)</h3>
            Assign a <b>non-primitive value</b> to a var using a <b>reference</b> keyword(pg 63). <b>Strings</b> are a
            grp. of letters & symbols.
            Create a string obj using a <b>constructor function</b> (pg 64). Use single quotations when creating a sting
            obj. Use double quotes inside
            a string literal, but you need to use single quate to enclose the string. When you use an apostrophes in
            your string, use double quote mark
            to enclose the string. (pg. 64) It's best practice to use single quotations if it's an obj. If a var
            refences a <b>non-primitve data type</b>
            array, function, or object the data w/in the object can change to a mutating object & mutated later. The var
            behavior has to remain consistent.
            You can use <b>backlashes</b> to escape using quotation marks (pg. 64-65).

            <h3>String Properties & Methods</h3>
            <b>Properties</b> are info abt the obj or value. While <b>methods</b> perform an action on an obj or value.
            A method is an action that a primitive
            type or obj can perform, using the (.) operator followed by the name of the method, followed by () (pg. 65).
            <b>Wrapper obj</b> (pg. 66). <br>

            <h3>Good Habits</h3>(pg.48-51)
            A <b>dot notation</b> can give you the string length property. Another method to access a primitive data
            type are: <b>square brackets</b><br>
            All properties of primitive data types are <b>immutable</b>, meaning they’re unable to
            be changed. You can try, but your efforts will be futile:
            <b>charAt</b>character positioning(pg. 67)<br>
            <b>indexOf</b> method tells you where a character or substring appeares in a string.<br>
            <b>lastIndexOf</b> tells you the last occurence of a char or substring.<br>
            <b>includes</b> method tells you what a string of certain char are.<br>
            <b>startWith()</b>lets you chk if a string start w/ a certain char.<br>
            <b>endWith</b>method lets you chk if a string ends w/ a particular char.<br>
            <b>concat()</b><br>
            <b>+'',''</b>concantenation shortcut<br>
            <b>trim()</b> method remove white space<br>
            <b>repeat()</b> method repeats a stringz.<br>

            <h3>Template Literals</h3>(pg. 71)
            A special type of string (ES6) use the backtick char. that use string interpolation. It can be used in both
            quote marks w/in a strng & JS expression
            can be inserted inside a string w/in { } as well. Template literals can also contain line breaks, which are
            converted into a line feed (\n). A backtick is
            expresses as \ or ` .<br>

            <h3>Symbol</h3>(pg. 72-73)
            A primitive value to avoid naming collisions using the <b>symbol function</b>. Symbol(add description here).
            <br>


            <h3>Numbers</h3>(pg 75) ― decimal, hexadecimal, octal, binary and exponent form, Infinity, and NaN <br>
            Number can be <b>intergers</b> which are whole numbers (you can use the method called Number.isInteger() to
            know if
            it's an integer, or <b>floating point numbrs</b> which are decimals or floats. Numbers have a constructor
            function.<br>

            <h3>Converting Numbers to Strings</h3>(pg. 85)
            The preferred way of changing a number to a string is to use the String function. Another option is to use
            the <b>toString()</b>
            method:This can also be used to change the base of the number.

            <h3>Parsing Numbers</h3>(pg. 86)
            There is also a useful function called <b>parseInt()</b> that can be used to convert a string representation
            of a numerical value
            back into a number. the parseInt function will use this number and
            ignore any letters that come afterwards:<br>

            <h3>Undefined & Null</h3>(pg. 88)
            <b>Undefined</b> is the value given to variables that have not been assigned a value. It can also occur if
            an object’s property doesn’t
            exist or a function has a missing parameter.<b>Null</b> means “no value”. null is coerced to be 0, making
            the sum possible whereas undefined is coerced to
            NaN, making the sum impossible to perform.(br)

            <h3>Octal & Hexadecimal Numbers</h3>(pg 76)
            <b>Octal & hexadecimal numbers</b> starts w/ an "ox" is a hexadecial (base 16) notation. <b>Exponential
                Numbers</b>
            use the exponential or scientific notation. <b>Number methods</b> have built-in methods; write this w/ an
            <b>toExpoential</b> method when working w/ number literals that are intergers.<br>

            <h3>Arithmetic operations(Converting btn Strings & Numbers) such as +, -, *, /, and %</h3>(pg. 78)
            You can do the followring in arithemtic operations.<br>
            <b>Change the value of a var using a compound assignment operator, +=;</b>(pg 79)
            <b>Increment values</b> with a ++<br>
            Incorporate the <b>infinity</b> to represent large numbers.<br>
            Use a <b>Nan</b> to express a value is not a number.<br>
            Chk a value is a number using the <b>Number</b>.isFinite() method.<br>
            Use a <b>type coercion</b> to show different types of an operand oprator.<br>
            You can parse numbers using the <b>parseInt()</b> function.<br>

            <h3>Undefined and null</h3>(pg. 88)
            Use an <b>Undefined</b> to express when a var is not assignmed to a value.<br>
            Use a <b>Null</b> as a placeholder to express that there is no value.<br>
            Undefined and null<br>

            <h3>Booleans ― truthy and falsy values</h3>(pg. 89)<br>
            This just mean that a logical statement value is either true or false. To find the Boolean value of
            something, you can use the <b>Boolean</b><br>

            <h3>Logical operators ― AND, OR, and NOT</h3>(pg.89)<br>
            <b>Logical operators</b> can be used w/ any primitive value or obj & the results are based on if the values
            are true
            false. <b>!(Logical Not)</b> will convert a statement into a Boolean and return the <b>opposite value</b>
            known as
            negation. <b>&t&t(Logical And)</b> works on 2 or more values and the value is only true if <b>all</b> the
            operands are
            true. A <b>II (Logical OR)</b> works on 2 or more values/operands and is true if 1 of the operands are
            true.<br>

            <b>Lazy Evalutaion</b>(pg. 924) you only check the minimum number of
            criteria that needs to be met.<br>
            <b>Bitwise operators</b>(pg. 93) Bitwise operators work with operands that are 32-bit integers. These are
            numbers
            written in binary (base two) that have 32 digits made up of just 0s and 1s.<br>
            <b>Bitwise Not(pg. 93)</b>The bitwise NOT operator ~ will convert the number to a 32-bit integer, then
            change all the 1s to 0 and all the 0s to 1s.<br>
            <b>Bitwise AND(pg> 94)</b>The bitwise AND operator, &, will convert both numbers into binary, and returns
            a number that in binary has a 1 in each position for which the corresponding bits
            of both operands are 1s.<br>
            <b>Bitwise XOR</b>(pg. 95) will convert both numbers into binary and return a number that in
            binary has a 1 in each position for which the corresponding bits of either
            operands are 1s, but not both 1s.<br>
            <b>Bitwise Shift Operator</b>(pg. 96)bitwise shift operators, with a double less & double greater sign, will
            move the binary representation a
            given number of places to the right or left, which effectively multiplies or divides
            the number by powers of two

            <h3>Comparison</h3>(pg. 96)
            <b>Equality</b>correct way to check for equality is to use either a double equals operator, ==,
            known as "soft equality" or the triple equals operator, ===, known as "hard
            equality".<br>
            <b>Soft Equality</b>correct way to check for equality is to use either a double equals operator, ==,
            known as "soft equality" or the triple equals operator, ===, known as "hard
            equality". Some values that are not actually equal to each other have a
            tendency to be reported as being equal when using the soft equality operator.<br>
            <b>Hard Equality</b>(pg. 98) hard, or strict, equality operator, ===, tests for equality but only returns
            true
            if and only if they are of the same data type. Hard equality reports that the variable answer is the number
            5,
            but not the string "5. The only strange result produced by hard equality is NaN is the only value in
            JavaScript that is not equal to itself!
            To deal with this, there is a special Number method called Number.isNaN().<br>
            <b>Inequality's One Quir</b>(pg 101)<br>

            <b>Greater Thank & Less Thank</b>(pg. 82-84) To check if two values are not equal using the inequality
            operator. There is a
            soft inequality operator, != and a hard inequality operator, !==.<br>
            Quiz (pg. 101) To ccheck if a value is greater than another using the > operator: and to check if a value is
            less than use the "less than"
            erator in a similar way. To check if a value is greater than or equal to another value, you can
            use the >= operator, but be careful; the equality test works in the same way as the soft equality
            operator:<br>

            <h1>CHAPTER 3</h1>(pg 108)

            <b>Arrays</b> are ordered list written in [ brackets], while <b>Mulitidimensional Arrays</b> are arrays that
            contain other arrays.<br>
            The <b>if</b> and <b>else</b> statement controls the flow of code. However, you can use the <b>switch</b>
            statement,
            instead of using multiple if and else statements.<br>

            The <b>while</b> and <b>do</b> loops are used are used to repeat a block code as long as the condition is
            true.<br>
            The <b>for</b> loop statement controls the flow of code that deals with iteration and executes the code
            repeatedly.<br>
            The <b>for-of</b> is used to iterate code in an array.

            <h3>Array literals</h3>
            An array is an ordered list of values. To create an array literal, simply write a pair
            of square brackets[]. Destructuring of an array is the the concept of taking vales out a
            of an array and placing them as individual values. Destructuring of arrays allows us to
            assign multiple values at the same time. To retrieve a specific value in an aray, we write
            its position in the [] sq bracket called the index.(pg. 90) To <b>add values</b> to an
            array, place the string in the element. The index <b>notation </b> is used to add new items
            to a position w/in the index. Unused slots in the index have an <b>undefined</b> value.<br>

            <h3>Array methods</h3>
            Using the <b>length</b> property allows you to manually make change. Unused slots in the index
            have an <b>undefined</b> value. <h3>Adding and removing values from arrays</h3><br>
            To <b>add values</b> to an array, place the string in the element. The index <b>notation
            </b> is used to add new items to a position w/in the index. <br>To <b>remove</b> a value
            from an array literal use the <b>delete</b> operator. Remove the last item from an array using
            a <b>pop</b> method, while the <b>shift </b> method removes the first item. The <b>push</b>
            method adds a new values to the end of the array. The <b>concat</b> will merge an array w/
            other arrays. Some other methods are: <b>join, slicing, splicing, reverse, & sort,</b>
            Find a if a values is in an array use the <b>indexOf</b> method. The include method will return
            a boolean value if it has a particular element. It can be used to add an extra parameter to
            indicate which index to start the search.Multidementional arrays which contains an array of an array. <br>

            <h3>Sets</h3>
            <b>Sets</b> offer a useful way to keep track of data without having to check if any values have
            been duplicated. You create a set w/ the <b>new</b> operat and the <b>Set</b> constructor. You can
            add values using the <b>add</b> method. To see the contents of a set enter the name of the var that
            refers to it. The number of values in a set can be found using the <b>size()</b> method.Other set
            methods are <b>has(),delete(), clear(), new Set(), Array.form()</b> A set can be converted into an array
            by placing the set, along with the spread operator directly inside an array literal. Objs are store into
            set as long as the set exists, when the set is removed *+& the set remains it can cause a memory leak,
            known as garbage-collected. It should be corrected to prevent future problems.<br>

            <h3>Maps</h3>
            Maps are a way of keeping a list of key & value pairs in other programming languages. (They are similiar to
            hashes, hash tables, & dictionaries). Maps can use any data type as a key. Use <b>size</b> propety to locate
            a number of key-value pairs. Create a map using the <b>new</b>operator & a <b>Map</b>br> constructor, & a
            <b>set()</b> method to add to your maps. Other methods used in maps are <b>get(), has(), delete(),
                clear(),</b>
            Maps can be converted into nested arrays of key-value pairs using the spread operator and like weak sets,
            weak
            maps can cause dead entries when the original obj is deleatd. Weak maps can use the <b>has(), get(), set(),
                and
                delete()</b> methods.<br>

            <h3>if and else logic statements</h3>
            Logic statement allow you to control the flow of a program by running different blocks of code. The if runs
            a block
            of code <b>if</b> the confition in the () is true. The <b>else</b> statement adds an alternative block of
            code to run
            the condition if it's false. A quick way of writing an <b>if else </b> is to use the ternary operator
            <b>?</b> followed
            by at least 2 operands.<br>

            <h3>switch statements</h3>
            <b>Switch</b> statements consist of several <b>if</b> & <b>else</b> statemets making up a logical decision
            tree. Use
            switch statement when there are several conditions to test. Use a <b>case</b> keyword for ea. possible value
            and
            remember to end your statement w/ a <b>break</b> to end the execution of the statement. <br>


            <h3>while loops</h3>
            What ever type of loop you run it's important that a condition is met or else your code will continue to run
            in a
            loop, this is known as an infinite loop. <b>While</b> loops runs a block of code continuously until a
            condition becomes
            true.<br>

            <h3>do … while loops</h3>
            <b>do while</b> loops is similiar to a while loop. The differences is that the conditions comes <i>after</i>
            the
            block code, regardless if the condition is true or not.<br>

            <h3>for loops</h3><br>
            In <b>for</b> loops the initialization code is ran before the loop start. The condition has to be satisfied
            for the
            loop to continue The after code is what to do after ea. iteration of the loop, which is mostly used to
            increment a
            counter. <br>

            <h3>nested for loops</h3>
            When a loop is placed inside of another loop this is a <b>nested loop</b>. It contains an inner loop that
            runs all
            the way through before the nest step of the outer loop occurs.<br>

            <h3>Iterating over a collection</h3>
            A for loop can be used to iterate over each value in an array. If we take our avengers array example from
            earlier,
            we can create a for loop that outputs each item in the array. Maps are also enumerable, so it's also
            possible to loop
            over a map in a similar way to a set. he loop will iterate over each key-value pair in the same order as
            they were
            added to the map. Maps are also enumerable, so it's also possible to loop over a map in a similar way to a
            set. The
            loop will iterate over each key-value pair in the same order as they were added to the map.<br>

            <h1>Chp 4 Functions</h1>
            <h2>PG. 151-</h2>
            Defining functions―function declarations, function expressions, Function() constructors and the new arrow
            syntax.<br>

            <h3>Invoking a function</h3><br>
            There are a number of ways to define a function in JavaScript. Three of the most common are covered below.
            Define functions,
            using what is known as an arrow notation. To define a function literal we can use a <b>function</b>
            declaration: like so
            <b>function()</b> keyword. You can also define a function using an <b>expression</b> that assigns a function
            to a var <br>
            <code>
                const goodbye = function(){<br>
                console.log('Goodbye World!');<br>
            </code>
            The 3rd way to define a function is w/ a constructor <b>Function()</b>, where it's entered as a string like
            so:<br>
            const hi new Function('console.log("Hi World!");'); It's recommend not to use this way because of <b>various
                problems</b>.
            Next you need to <b>invoke</b> a function inside of the funciton's body. This is done by entering it's name
            followed by ():<br>
            <code>
                hello();<br>
                'Hello world!'<br>
            </code>

            FOOT NOTE:Don’t Repeat Yourself,or DRY, is a principle of programming that specifies that every part of a
            program should
            only be written once. This voids duplication and means there’s no need to keep multiple pieces of code up to
            date and in sync.<br>

            <h3>Return values</h3>
            All functions return a value, which can be specified using the return statement, which comes after the
            <b>return</b>
            keyword. A function that doesn’t
            explicitly return anything (such as all the examples we have seen so far) will return <b>undefined</b> by
            default.<br>

            <h3>Parameters and arguments</h3>
            <b>Parameters</b> and <b>arguments</b> are terms that are often used interchangeably to represent values
            provided for the
            function as an input. There is a subtle difference though: any parameters a function needs are set when the
            function is defined.
            When a function isinvoked, it is provided with arguments. you can use a single parameter or several. If the
            parameter is empty
            it's <b>undefined</b> & an undefined parameter will return a <b>NaN</b>.When too many arguments are entered
            into a function we
            can either use a <b>mean()</b> function to calculate numbers or use the var <b>arguments</b> for multiple
            arguments. This acts
            like an array. However for BEST PRACTICE it's better to use a <b>rest</b> operator. We can use a rest
            parameter to improve our
            <b>mean()</b> function so it accepts any number of values. <b>default perameters</b> in a function are
            values that will
            be used by the function if no arguments are provided when it is invoked. To specify a default parameter,
            simply assign
            the default value to it in the function definition. <b>arrow =></b> syntax help make declaring functions
            more succinct
            using less verbose syntax. <br>
            const square = x => x*x;<br>

            <h3>Hoisting―variables and functions</h3>
            Hoisting is the JavaScript interpreter’s action of moving all variable and function declarations to the top
            of the current scope,
            regardless of where they are defined. Functions that are defined using a function declaration are
            automatically hoisted, meaning
            they can be invoked before they have been defined. Use a <b>hoist()</b> to invoke a function. This allows
            you to all <b>function
                definitions</b> together at the end of the program. <b>variable hoisting</b> that use the var keyword
            are automatically moved to
            the top of the current scope. Variable assignment is not hoisted, however. This means that a variable
            assigned at the end of a
            function will have a value of undefined until the assignment is made. When using var hoist, use <b>const</b>
            & <b>let</b> to
            delcare variable at the beginning of a block so hoisting is unnessary.

            <h3>Callbacks―functions as a parameter</h3>
            Functions can also be given as a parameter to another function. A function that is passed as an argument to
            another is known as a
            <b>callback</b>.Callback functions are made more flexible using the callback parameter.<br>function
            sing(song,callback) {<br>
            console.log(`I'm singing along to ${song}.);<br>
            callback();<br>
            <br>
            The actual callback is invoked in the body of the function where the () are used. You can sort arrays w/ a
            <b>sort()</b> method using
            a callback. You can also do this with a <b>numericallys function</b> and the sort() to sort numbers. An
            <b>array iterator</b> uses
            several ways to use callbacks, making them more flexible. It also uses the arrow notation in many of the
            callback methods. The
            <b>foreEach()</b> to loop through multiple values, the <b>map()</b> method to iterate through an array, so
            forces the callback function
            as a parameter that invokes the items in an array. Other methods used are: <b> Reduce() & filter()</b>. The
            <b>mean()</b> function can
            be added to the reduce() method to add up all the values provided in an argument.<br>
            <code>
                Ex:

                <input type="text" id="text1" name="Enter first number"><br>
                <input type="text" id="text2" name="Enter second number"><br>
                Result: <br>
                <input type="text" id="txtresult" placeholder="TextBox3"><br>
                <button onclick="add_numbers()" value="display_result">Display Results</button>
                <!--<div id="result"></div>-->
                <br>
            </code>


            <h3>JavaScript</h3>
            CHAPTER 4
            (Passing the Argument)
            A callback function is passed as an argument into another function. It contains a
            string of code. You call the function by naming it, & it's followed by ( ), this
            tells the function to execute the code in thee ( ).
            The argument consist of a method that has an event(onclick) & a function of (whatToDo).
            The addEventListener method executes the function only when an event occurs.
