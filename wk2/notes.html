    <h3>JavaScript grammar ― expressions, statements, semicolons and whitespace</h3><br>
    JS programs use multiple statements, ending w/ a new line or semicolon. Ex pg. 52
    nessary to add a ( ; ) to end a statement because JS uses ASI that can place
    ( ; ) @ the end for you. This can however be error prone and prevent minifies &
    validator to not work. It’s best practice to write ea. Statement on a new line.
    <br>
    Block statements in curly brackets; don’t have to be terminated by ( ; )
    White spaces separate various part of ea. Statement.
    Reserved words for JS pg. 53 avoid naming var or files w/ these.
    <br>
    <h3>Primitive data types</h3><br>
    JS has 6 primitive data type: Strings, Numbers, Symbols, Boolean, Undefined, & Null.
    JS also has 1 object type which includes: Arrays, Functions, & Object literals.
    JS special operator (typeof) is used for finding the value type (pg 36)
    Operators apply an operation to a value known as operand A unary operator requires 1
    operand, while a binary operator requires 2 operands. A ternary operator requires 3
    operands. There are 3 string vars : string literals, string properties and methods
    <br>
    <h3>Declaring and assigning constants and variables</h3><br>
    Variables refer to a stored value. You must declare a var first b4 it can be used. Key words
    like (const) & (let) are used to declare var. const is used when a var will not be reassigned
    another value. It’s best practice to use a const var let is use the value might be reassigned
    later. Assign a value w/ the (=) operator.
    <code>
    <span style="color:red;font-size:17px"><b>Q:</b> What is ES6?</span>
    </code>
    ES6 is ECMAScript 6
    <br>
    <h3>You can declare a var and assign string names</h3><br>
    Along w/ string names you can assign multiple comma-deliberated variables at the same time.
    If a var refences a <b>non-primitve data type</b> array, function, or object the data w/in
    the object can change to a mutating object & mutated later. The var behavior has to remain
    consistent.
    <br>
    <h4>Scopes</h4><br>
    Using <b>const</b> & <b>let </b>to declare var means they are block scoped. Their values only
    exists inside the blocks. There are 2 types of scopes, global & local. Global scopes are var declard
    outside of a block making it accessible throuhout the program. This is <i>NOT GOOD PRACTICE</i>. local
    scope are var inside a block, & uses the let or const are only available inside the block it's created
    in. However, it let or const are not used then the var are considered global scopes & are available
    outside of the block. Both const & let are defined inside the block (pg. 43)
    <br>
    <h3>Naming Constants & Variables</h3><br>
    Name var that describe what the var represent. They can start w/ upper & lower case letters, an underscore,
    or a dollar character, as well as contain numbers, as long as they don't start w/ numbers. Avoid using
    underscors and dollar sign at the beginning of your named var, it can cause problems. Constant & var are 
    case sensitive. If using multiple words to name your var follow these rules.<br>
    <code>
    <p class="tab">Example of a tab</p><br>
    <b>Camel case </b> starts w/ lowercase & ea. new word is capitalized.<br>
    firstNameAndLastName<br>
    <b>Underscore</b>separates ea. new word w/ an underscore.<br>
    first_name_and_last_name
    </code>
        <br>
    <h3>Direct Assignment & Assignment By Reference(pg. 45)</h3><br>
    Assign a <b>non-primitive value</b> to a var using a <b>reference</b> keyword(pg 45).  <b>Strings</b> are a grp. 
    of letters & symbols. Create a string obj using a <b>constructor function</b> (pg 46). Using single & double 
    quotes, & apostrophes in your string (pg. 46).  You can use <b>backlashes</b> to escape using quotation marks. 
    (pg. 46-47). <b>Properties</b> are info abt the obj or value. While <b>methods</b>> are perform an action on an obj.
    or value. A method is an action that a primitive data type or obj can perform, using the (.) operator followed 
    by the name of the method, followed by () (pg. 49). <b>Wrapper obj</b> (pg. 47). <br>
    <h3>Good Habits</h3>(pg.48-51)<br>
    A <b>dot notation</b> can give you the string length property. Another method to access a primitive data type are:
    <b>square brackets</b><br>
    <b>charAt</b>character positioning(pg. 49 )<br>
    <b>indexOf</b> method tells you where a character or substring appeares in a string.<br>
    <b>lastIndexOf</b> tells you the last occurence of a char or substring.<br>
    <b>includes</b> method tells you what a string of certain char are.<br>
    <b>startWith()</b>lets you chk if a string start w/ a certain char.<br>
    <b>endWith</b>method lets you chk if a string ends w/ a particular char.<br>
    <b>concat()</b><br>
    <b>+'',''</b>concantenation shortcut<br>
    <b>trim()</b> method remove white space<br>
    <b>repeat()</b> method repeats a string
    <br>
    <h3>Template Literals</h3>(pg. 52-53)<br>
    A special type of string (ES6) use the backtick char. that use string interpolation.
    <br>
    <h3>Symbol</h3>(pg. 53-55)<br>
    A primitive value to avoid naming collisions using the symbol function. Symbol()
    <br>
    <h3>Numbers ― decimal, hexadecimal, octal, binary and exponent form, Infinity, and NaN</h3> (pg55-64)<br>
    Number can be <b>intergers</b> whichare whole numbers or <b>floating point numbrs</b> which are decimals or
    floats. Numbers have a constructor function. <b>Octal & hexadecimal numbers</b> starts w/ an "ox" is a
    hexadecial (bse 16) notation. <b>Exponential Numbers</b> use the exponential or scientific notation.
    <b>Number methods</b> have built-in methods; write this w/ an <b>toExpoential</b> method when working w/ number
    literals that are intergers.
    <br>
    <h3>Arithmetic operations(Converting btn Strings & Numbers) such as +, -, *, /, and %</h3>(pg.59-60)<br>
    You can do the followring in arithemtic operations<br>
    <p class="tab">Example of a tab</p><br>
    change the value of a var using a <b>compound assignment operator, +=;</b><br>
    <p><b>Increment values</b> with a ++<br>
    Incorporate the <b>infinity</b> to represent large numbers.<br>
    Use a <b>Nan</b> to express a value is not a number.<br>
    Chk a value is a number using the <b>Number</b>.isFinite() method.<br>
    Use a <b>type coercion</b> to show different types of an operand oprator.<br>
    You can parse numbers using the <b>parseInt()</b> function.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Undefined and null</h3>(pg. 69)<br>
    Use an <b>Undefined</b> to express when a var is not assignmed to a value.<br>
    Use a <b>Null</b> as a placeholder to express that there is no value.<br>
    Undefined and null<br>
    <h3>Booleans ― truthy and falsy values</h3>(pg. 70)<br>
    This just mean that a logical statement value is either true or false.<br>

    <h3>Logical operators ― AND, OR, and NOT</h3>(pg.71)<br>
    <b>Logical operators</b> can be used w/ any primitive value or obj & the results are based on if the values  are true 
    false. <b>!(Logical Not)</b> will convert a statement into a Boolean and return the <b>opposite value</b> known as
    negation. <b>&t&t(Logical And)</b> works on 2 or more values and the value is only true if <b>all</b> the operands are
    true. A <b>II (Logical OR)</b> works on 2 or more values/operands and is true if 1 of the operands are true.<br>

    <h2>Arrays, Logic, & Loops</h2>*pg 88-129)<br>
    CHAPTER 3<br>
    <h3>Array literals</h3><br>
    An array is an ordered list of values. To create an array literal, simply write a pair
    of square brackets[]. Destructring of an array is the the concept of taking vales out a
    of an array and placing them as individual values. Destructuring of arrays allows us to
    assign multiple values at the same time. To retrieve a specific value in an aray, we write
    its position in the [] sq bracket called the index.(pg. 90) To <b>add values</b> to an
    array, place the string in the element. The index <b>notation </b> is used to add new items
    to a position w/in the index. Unused slots in the index have an <b>undefined</b> value.<br>

    <h3>Array methods</h3><br>
    Using the <b>length</b> property allows you to manually make change. Unused slots in the index
    have an <b>undefined</b> value. <h3>Adding and removing values from arrays</h3><br>
    To <b>add values</b> to an array, place the string in the element. The index <b>notation
    </b> is used to add new items to a position w/in the index. <br>To <b>remove</b> a value
    from an array literal use the <b>delete</b> operator. Remove the last item from an array using
    a <b>pop</b> method, while the <b>shift </b> method removes the first item. The <b>push</b>
    method adds a new values to the end of the array. The <b>concat</b> will merge an array w/
    other arrays. Some other methods are: <b>join, slicing, splicing, reverse, & sort,</b>
    Find a if a values is in an array use the <b>indexOf</b> method. The include method will return
    a boolean value if it has a particular element. It can be used to add an extra parameter to
    indicate which index to start the search.Multidementional arrays which contains an array of an array. <br>

    <h3>Sets</h3><br>
    <b>Sets</b> offer a useful way to keep track of data without having to check if any values have
    been duplicated. You create a set w/ the <b>new</b> operat and the <b>Set</b> constructor. You can
    add values using the <b>add</b> method. To see the contents of a set enter the name of the var that
    refers to it. The number of values in a set can be found using the <b>size()</b> method.Other set
    methods are <b>has(),delete(), clear(), new Set(), Array.form()</b> A set can be converted into an array
    by placing the set, along with the spread operator directly inside an array literal. Objs are store into
    set as long as the set exists, when the set is removed *+& the set remains it can cause a memory leak,
    known as garbage-collected. It should be corrected to prevent future problems.<br>

    <h3>Maps</h3><br>
    Maps are a way of keeping a list of key & value pairs in other programming languages. (They are similiar to
    hashes, hash tables, & dictionaries). Maps can use any data type as a key. Use <b>size</b> propety to locate
    a number of key-value pairs. Create a map using the <b>new</b>operator & a <b>Map</b>br> constructor, & a
    <b>set()</b> method to add to your maps. Other methods used in maps are <b>get(), has(), delete(), clear(),</b>
    Maps can be converted into nested arrays of key-value pairs using the spread operator and like weak sets, weak
    maps can cause dead entries when the original obj is deleatd. Weak maps can use the <b>has(), get(), set(), and
    delete()</b> methods.<br>

    <h3>if and else logic statements</h3><br>
    Logic statement allow you to control the flow of a program by running different blocks of code. The if runs a block
    of code <b>if</b> the confition in the () is true. The <b>else</b> statement adds an alternative block of code to run
    the condition if it's false. A quick way of writing an <b>if else </b> is to use the ternary operator <b>?</b> followed
    by at least 2 operands.<br>

    <h3>switch statements</h3><br>
    <b>Switch</b> statements consist of several <b>if</b> & <b>else</b> statemets making up a logical decision tree. Use
    switch statement when there are several conditions to test. Use a <b>case</b> keyword for ea. possible value and
    remember to end your statement w/ a <b>break</b> to end the execution of the statement. <br>


    <h3>while loops</h3><br>
    What ever type of loop you run it's important that a condition is met or else your code will continue to run in a
    loop, this is known as an infinite loop. <b>While</b> loops runs a block of code continuously until a condition becomes
    true.<br>

    <h3>do … while loops</h3><br>
    <b>do while</b> loops is similiar to a while loop. The differences is that the conditions comes <i>after</i> the
    block code, regardless if the condition is true or not.<br>
    
    <h3> for loops</h3><br>
    In <b>for</b> loops the initialization code is ran before the loop start. The condition has to be satisfied for the
    loop to continue The after code is what to do after ea. iteration of the loop, which is mostly used to increment a 
    counter. <br>

    <h3>nested for loops</h3><br>
    When a loop is placed inside of another loop this is a <b>nested loop</b>. It contains an inner loop that runs all
    the way through before the nest step of the outer loop occurs.<br>   

    <h3>Iterating over a collection</h3><br>
    A for loop can be used to iterate over each value in an array. If we take our avengers array example from earlier,
    we can create a for loop that outputs each item in the array. Maps are also enumerable, so it's also possible to loop 
    over a map in a similar way to a set. he loop will iterate over each key-value pair in the same order as they were 
    added to the map. Maps are also enumerable, so it's also possible to loop over a map in a similar way to a set. The 
    loop will iterate over each key-value pair in the same order as they were added to the map.<br>

    <h3>Functions</h3><br>
    Chapter 4 <br>
    Defining functions―function declarations, function expressions, Function() constructors and the new arrow syntax. 
    
    <h3>Invoking a function</h3
    There are a number of ways to define a function in JavaScript. Three of the most common are covered below. ES6
    introduced a new way to define functions, using what is known as an arow notation. To define a function literal we 
    can use a <b>function</b> declaration: like so <b>function()</b> keyword. You can also define a function using an
    <b>expression</b> that assigns a function to a var <br>
    const goodbye = function(){<br>
    console.log('Goodbye World!');<br>
    The 3rd way to define a function is w/ a constructor <b>Function()</b>, where it's entered as a string like so:<br>
    const hi new Function('console.log("Hi World!");'); It's recommend not to use this way because of <b>various problems</b>. 
    Next you need to <b>invoke</b> a function inside of the funciton's body. This is done by entering it's name followed by ():<br>
    hello();<br>
    'Hello world!'<br>
    FOOT NOTE:Don’t Repeat Yourself,or DRY, is a principle of programming that specifies that every part of a program should 
    only be written once. This voids duplication and means there’s no need to keep multiple pieces of code up to date and in sync.<br>
   
    <h3>Return values</h3><br>
    All functions return a value, which can be specified using the return statement, which comes after the <b>return</b>
    keyword. A function that doesn’t
    explicitly return anything (such as all the examples we have seen so far) will return <b>undefined</b> by default.<br>
   
    <h3>Parameters and arguments</h3><br>
    <b>Parameters</b> and <b>arguments</b> are terms that are often used interchangeably to represent values provided for the 
    function as an input. There is a subtle difference though: any parameters a function needs are set when the function is defined. 
    When a function isinvoked, it is provided with arguments. you can use a single parameter or several. If the parameter is empty 
    it's <b>undefined</b> & an undefined parameter will return a <b>NaN</b>.When too many arguments are entered into a function we 
    can either use a <b>mean()</b> function to calculate numbers or use the var <b>arguments</b> for multiple arguments. This acts 
    like an array. However for BEST PRACTICE it's better to use a <b>rest</b> operator. We can use a rest parameter to improve our
    <b>mean()</b> function so it accepts any number of values. <b>default perameters</b> in a function are values that will 
    be used by the function if no arguments are provided when it is invoked. To specify a default  parameter, simply assign 
    the default value to it in the function definition. <b>arrow =></b> syntax help make declaring functions more succinct 
    using less verbose syntax. <br>
    const square = x => x*x;<br>
   
    <h3>Hoisting―variables and functions</h3><br>
    Hoisting is the JavaScript interpreter’s action of moving all variable and function declarations to the top of the current scope, 
    regardless of where they are defined. Functions that are defined using a function declaration are automatically hoisted, meaning 
    they can be invoked before they have been defined. Use a <b>hoist()</b> to invoke a function. This allows you to all <b>function 
    definitions</b> together at the end of the program. <b>variable hoisting</b> that use the var keyword are automatically moved to 
    the top of the current scope. Variable assignment is not hoisted, however. This means that a variable assigned at the end of a 
    function will have a value of undefined until the assignment is made. When using var hoist, use <b>const</b> & <b>let</b> to
    delcare variable at the beginning of a block so hoisting is unnessary.<br>

    <h3>Callbacks―functions as a parameter</h3><br>
    Functions can also be given as a parameter to another function. A function that is passed as an argument to another is known as a 
    <b>callback</b>.Callback functions are made more flexible using the callback parameter.<br>function sing(song,callback) {<br>
    console.log(`I'm singing along to ${song}.);<br>
    callback();<br>
    <br>
    The actual callback is invoked in the body of the function where the () are used. You can sort arrays w/ a <b>sort()</b> method using 
    a callback. You can also do this with a <b>numericallys function</b> and the sort() to sort numbers. An <b>array iterator</b> uses 
    several ways to use callbacks, making them more flexible. It also uses the arrow notation in many of the callback methods. The 
    <b>foreEach()</b> to loop through multiple values, the <b>map()</b> method to iterate through an array, so forces the callback function 
    as a parameter that invokes the items in an array. Other methods used are: <b> Reduce() & filter()</b>. The <b>mean()</b> function can 
    be added to the reduce() method to add up all the values provided in an argument.
    

        <code>
        Ex:

            <input type="text" id="text1" name="Enter first number"><br>
            <input type="text" id="text2" name="Enter second number"><br>
            Result: <br>
            <input type="text" id="txtresult" placeholder="TextBox3"><br>
            <button onclick="add_numbers()" value="display_result">Display Results</button>
             <!--<div id="result"></div>-->
            <br>
        </code>    
    
    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    CHAPTER 4
    (Passing the Argument)
     A callback function is passed as an argument into another function. It contains a
    string of code. You call the function by naming it, & it's followed by ( ), this
    tells the function to execute the code in thee ( ).
    The argument consist of a method that has an event(onclick) & a function of (whatToDo).
    The addEventListener method executes the function only when an event occurs.
