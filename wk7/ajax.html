<!--Each button will be used to make a different type of Ajax request. One will request plain text and the other will request a JSON string from an external API. The div with an id of 'output' will be where weâ€™ll insert the response we receive from the Ajax request.-->
<!--For our Ajax requests, we'll be using a couple of online APIs. The first isNumbersAPI, which returns facts about random numbers as a text string. The second ischucknorris.io, which returns a JSON string, containing a random satirical factoid about everybody's favorite hard man, Chuck Norris.-->
