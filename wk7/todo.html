    <!-- #1 What methods and properties you might need to implement your comments. A comment should consist of at least 
        the name of the hike it is for, a date, and the actual text of the comment. You will also need a comment type to 
        use as a key for when we store these to local storage. Adding a type flag allows us to add comments for different 
        things and grab all of them or keep them separate-->
