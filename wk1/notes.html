            <h1>WK 1 Doing Stuff With The Web</h1>
            <h2>Make It Nice</h2>
            <code>
                <a href='https://github.com/yenrab/doing_stuff_with_web_things/tree/6009270a0ddce5a42675e0abe9c9c0232fa97185'

            </code>
            <b>Functions</b> are a type of operation which:<br>
            1. Function syntax has the <b>function</b> keyword at the start of the code.<br>
            2. It has a (verb) name. Start with lowever case & camel case the first letter of each word afterwards.<br>
            3. Things that goes in the function. Is inside the ().<br>
            4. Things that come out of the function are located in the {}, as well as things that make up what the function does goes here.<br><br>

            Ex:<br>
            <b>function</b> theFunctionName(whatGoesIn){<br>
                Instructions: what the computer does<br>
            }
                <br>
            
            <code>
                <a href="../WDD340/wk1/main.js">Code: Function Ex.</a>
            </code><br><br>
           <b>Note:</b>Place your function within the script tags. Since you have to tell the computer the id of the element you want
           found, you are responsible for there being an element that has that
           id. (look at the example in the fir st_event.html file below. If you forget to add an id or send getElementById the wrong id,
           youâ€™re going to get a strange error when you click the button. The
           error will mention null. Since button and section are both tags, you can change what is in
between their starting and ending tags using the same thing; innerHTML. <br>

            Create a button using the <b>button</b> tag. An example is in the first_event.html folder
            <code>
                <a href="../WDD340/wk1/first_event.html">first_event.html Ex.</a>
            </code><br>
            Add the button html code in the body and the JS code in the script tag between the head tags of the html doc.
            To get the button to update after clicking it you need to modify the code as such: <br>

                Ex:<br>
                <u>change from:</u> (button tag Click me! /button tag)<br><br>
                <u>change to:</u> (buttontag onclick="showCongratulations(this)">Click Me! /button tag)<br><br>
           
            This is the <b>event</b> aspect of the function, which executes the code. Since button and section are both tags, you can change 
            what is in between their starting and ending tags using the same thing; innerHTML.

            <h1>Master Mobile UX</h1>
            <h2>Rewired The Brain For Mobile First</h2><br>
            Focus on making content to fit small screens first for functionality. Just because you make your code <b>responsive</b> doesn't 
            mean it mobile first. This is when you take what you have & make it work on mobile, but this does not address the screen size or
            touch site issues.<br>
            PROS &  CONS: <br>
                It's time consuming & costly.<br>
                Provides experience across many devices.<br>
                Address constraints of mobile size/bandwith.<br>
                Future Friendly & ready for scaling up.<br>

            <h2>Improve UX by Understanding Users</h2><br>
            <u>Observe</u> what the user is doing, not what they say. Be available, useful, and be quick by reducing the user cognitive load.<br>
            <u>Reachability</u>-how the users handle the device. Make this easy, for example key items should be at the bottom of the device where 
            it's easy to reach.<br>
            <u>Speed matters</u>-how is the client/user's buisiness effected? For example delays can effect revenue.<br>
                reduce image<br>
                svg/webfonts are lower bandwidth<br>
                optimized & minify CSS & JS files. Remove white space.<br>
                GZip files to eliminate unnecessary data.<br>

            <h2>Strategic Menu Design></h2><br>
            Use Primary Controls<br>
                Move nav bar & commonly used sub navigations to the bottom of the device.
                    This promotes reachability issues.<br>
                    Creates perception of speed<br>
                    Improves engagement rates<br>
                    Increased user satifaction<br>
                Use icons that are easy recognizable like the word menu with a boarder that looks like a button.<br>
            
            <h2>Mobile Friendly Forms</h2><br>
            Focus on important things first, and keep it simple.<br>
                Ditch the labels and display the label inside of the text box.<br>
                Use float labels.<br>
                Make check boxes larger.<br>
                Ask customer preference of contact (email or phone).<br>
                Break a form down into sections when more input is needed.<br>
                Include a progress indicator. Enable autocomple on the form<br>
                For password show the password and allow the user to hide the password when needed.<br>
                Use an auto advance for credit/bank cards.<br>
                For number use the number pad instead of the keyboard.<br>
                Use an <a> </a> tag to link your phone number.

            <h2>Advertising</h2><br>
            When adding ads or popups keep them small and simple  no more thant 40% of your space).<br>
            If using lardge ads start with a small thumbnail that enlarges to a larger image when clicked on.<br>
            Use video ads.<br>
            Use ads that are in the background while the text is in the foreground.<br>
            Things to remember<br>
                stop using pop-ups/pop-overs<br>
                users don't visit your webisite to look at ads
                keep it simple & sleek.<br>
                Make it unobtrusive. Content first.<br>



            <h2></h2><br>


            Avoid popups, but if placing ads keep it small & simple
