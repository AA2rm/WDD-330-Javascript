            <h2>Javascript.Info</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://javascript.info/object-methods" title="GitHub-Yenrab"> Doing Stuff With Web
                        Things</a></li>
            </ul>
            <b>Objects</b> are created to represent entities like users, orders, etc... & are object methods such as
            "this", while <b>actions</b> are represented
            by JS function properties. <b>Function expressions</b> are used to create a function & assign properties to
            it. You can also write a method in shorthand
            omiting the 'function' key word, which is the preferred syntax. See Create a shorthand function in the
            (main.js)link below:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="main.js">Code Examples</a>
                </li>
            </ul><br>
            When we write our code using objects to represent entities, that’s called object-oriented programming, in
            short: “OOP”. For the Object method to retrieve
            information stored in the object use the <b>this</b> keyword which calls the method. (See main.js) Ex: Use
            this to call method. in the link above. You can also
            retrieve a method from the outer variable, but it's not recommended. <b>this</b> is not bound (locked) to
            only one function. n JavaScript this is “free”, its value
            is evaluated at call-time and does not depend on where the method was declared, but rather on what object is
            “before the dot”. The concept of run-time evaluated
            this has both pluses and minuses. On the one hand, a function can be reused for different objects. On the
            other hand, the greater flexibility creates more
            possibilities for mistakes.It can be used in other objects. (See main.js) Assign 'this' to two different
            object calls. Functions can be called w/o objs (See main.js)
            Ex: Call a function without an object, in the link above. In this case this is undefined in strict mode. If
            we try to access this.name, there will be an error. In
            non-strict mode the value of this in such case will be the global object (window in a browser, we’ll get to
            it later in the chapter Global object). This is a
            historical behavior that "use strict" fixes. Arrow functions are special: they don’t have their “own” this.
            If we reference this from such a function, it’s taken from
            the outer “normal” function. You can use an arrow() this. from an outter method (See main.js) link above

            <u>Summary</u>
            <ul>

                <li>Functions that are stored in object properties are called “methods”.</li>
                <li>Methods allow objects to “act” like object.doSomething().</li>
                <li>Methods can reference the object as this.</li>
                <li>he value of this is defined at run-time./.

                <li>When a function is declared, it may use this, but that this has no value until the function is
                    called.</li>
                <li>A function can be copied between objects.</li>
                <li>hen a function is called in the “method” syntax: object.method(), the value of this during the call
                    is object.</li>
                <li>Arrow functions are special: they have no this. When this is accessed inside an arrow function, it
                    is taken from outside.</li>
            </ul>


            <h2>Chapter5: Objects</h2>(Pg. 185)
            There are several ways to write programming lang.
            <b>low-level programming language</b> is written in abstract code relating to the computer's archtecture.
            <b>high-level programming language</b> lanugauges that uses C, C++, or Java uses languages that are fast.
            This is suited for games and business software.
            <b>scripting lanugages</b> are high level languages, like JS, transformed into machine code at run time.
            Sometimes they are slow at compiling languages.<br>

            Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript & XML) allowed data from a server in the background & updated relevant part of
            the webpages w/o the need for a full page reload. Node.js allows server-side applications to be written in
            JS &
            for web apps to be written in JS. It has many app & JS libraries that doen't use the browser at all. It has
            also allow for <b>Isomorphic JS</b> that lets the same JS code run on both the client or server side. <br>

            Implementations of JS vary from engine to engine caseing browser to behave differently when running JS.
            JavaScript and HTML5 technologies can be used to <b>develop browser extensions, Windows desktop widgets
                and Chrome OS applications non-web-related applications, to add interactivity to PDF documents, interact
                with a database, and even control household appliances.</b><br>

            Note:download Node.js: The installer(Windows) or Node Version Manager.<br>
            <b>Validate Node</b>installation - node -v; it returns the node version.<br>
            <b>Vaidate REPL</b>type node; returns><br>
            <b>Exit REPL</b> hold the ctrl key & hit C twice.<br>

            The <b>E66 Console</b> lets you enter in JS commonad directly in the browser & see the results. Other
            options are Notepad++, Atom text editor, Brackets. There are also IDEs like MS VS, and online options are
            CodePen, JSFiddle, & JS Bin.<br>

            Web pages have 3 layers HTML the markup, CSS design/presentation, & JS the interactive. These layers should
            be kept separate. JS is kept separate from HTML with a <b>script></b> tag. To link your JS to the HTML &
            keep it unobtrusive use the best practice of writing a script tag for JS is in the footer below.<br>


            Use a<b>progressive enhancement</b> builds a web page from the ground up w/ a base level of functionality,
            then adds extra enhancements if they are available in the browser. <b>document.getElementById</b> function
            to
            find the HTML element with the ID of btn, this is assigned to the btn variable.<br>

            <b>Syntactic sugar</b> allows an existing piece of code to be written in a niceer & more succinct way,
            making it backwardly compatble. <b>Transpilers</b>convert code from one version of JS into another.
            RESOURCE: Here's a transpiler Babel listed in the footer.<br>

            If you find that some code isn't working in your browser, you can add the following link into your HTML
            document. Note that this link needs to gobeforeany JavaScript that needs to be transpiled.<br>

            You also have to change the type attribute to 'text/babel' in any links to JavaScript files. For example,
            the link to the JavaScript file in the example above would change to: <br>

            script type='text/babel' src='main.js'>script (add in the greater then & less than on the script tags).
            Every id attribute should be unique to just one element. If no element exists with the ID provided, null is
            returned. The<b>getElementsByTagName()</b> will return a live node list of all the elements with the tag
            name that is provided as an argument. The
            <b>getElementsByClassName() </b>
            return a live node list of all elements that have the class name that is supplied as an argument.<br>

        <section id="obj_model">
            <h2>Chapter 6: DOM's</h2><br>
            The <b>Document Object Model, or DOM</b> for short, represents a HTML document as a network of connected
            nodes that form a tree-like structure. We can use JavaScript to access and modify different parts of a web
            page
            using a special built-in obj called <b>document.</b><br>

            <b>Console Shortcuts</b><br>
            Pressing TAB will autocomplete any methods and should show you a list of possible methods. Pressing the UP
            arrow key will select the previous command entered. The <b>DOM</b> provides several methods that allow us to access any element on a
            page. These methods will return a node object or a node list, which is an arraylike
            object. These objects can then be assigned to a variable and be inspected or
            modified. Both<b>document.querySelector()</b> &
 
            <h2>NOD's</h2>
            All nodes have a numerical code to signify what type they are:<br>
            Ex.

            <b>Code</b>     <b>Type</b>
            1                   element<br>
            2                   attribute<br>
            3                   text<br>
            8                   comment<br>
            9                   body<br>

            Commonly used elements<br>
            Document.body returns the body element of a web page.<br>
            Document.images returns a node list of all the images in the document.<br>
            Document.links returns a node list of all the <b>a</b> tag elements and <b>area</b> tag elements that have an href attribute.<br>
            Document.anchors returns a node list of all the <b>a</b> tag elements that have a name attribute.<br>
            Document.forms returns a node list of all the forms in the document.<br>

            <b>getElementById()</b> will return a reference to the unique element with the ID provided as an
            argument.<br>

            <b>getElementByTagName()</b> will return a live node list of all the elements with the
            tag name that is provided as an argument.<br>

            <b>getElementsByClassName()</b> will return a live node list of all elements that have
                the class name that is supplied as an argument<br>

              
            <b>document.querySelector()</b> method allows you to use CSS notation to find
            the first element in the document that matches a CSS selector provided as an
            argument. If no elements match, it will return null. querySelector() method can be called on any element, rather than just
            document<br>

            <b>document.querySelectorAll()</b>
            are method that location the first element and all of the elements in a document. A <b>querySelector()</b>
            method can be called onanyelement, rather than just document . For example, we can get a reference to the 'ul'
            element, & the lastChild property returns the last child of a node.<br>

            <b>CSS pseudo-selector</b> can also be used to pinpoint a particular element, return only the last list item in the
            document<br>

            <b>Node</b> objects have a number of properties and methods for navigating around the document tree Once you have a 
            reference to an element, you can walk along the document tree to find other nodes. 'li' tags.<br>

            The <b>parentNode</b> property returns the parent node of an element.<br>
            The <b>childNodes</b> property is a list of all the nodes that are children of the node concerned. The
            following example will return all the child nodes of the element with an id that your searhing for. The <b>firstChild</b>
            property returns the first child of a node. Once you locate the reference to the text node, you can find the text 
            inside it useing the <b>nodeValue</b> method. The <b>nextSibling</b> property returns the next adjacent node of the same 
            parent. The<b>previousSibling </b> property returns the previous adjacent node. Both the nextSibling & previousSibling 
            properties will return null if the node is the first child of that parent.<br>

            When finding the text w/in the element, remember that the text is held in the element's<b>text node</b>

            <h2>Getting & Setting Attributes</h2>
            You can get and set attributes w/ various method that ca be used to <b>view, add, remove or modify</b> the
            value of these attributes. Use the <b>getAttribute()</b> or the <b>setAttributes</b> with these methods. 
            notation retrieves access to various attributes. <br>


            The<h2>className Property</h2>
            The <b>setAttribute()</b> method lets you modify a class
            name. While <b>classList</b> property is a list of all the classes an element has. It has a number of methods that make
            it easier modify the class of an element. The <b>add</b> method is used to add a class to an element without
            overwriting any classes that already exist. There are other methods sucha as <b>remove & toggle,</b> It can be used to 
            find out the value of the class attribute, change the class name by modifying the class name To add and extra class to 
            an element for old browsers us an <b>addClass</b>element. Ex: The example is in
            JS<br>

            <b>createElement() method</b>(Pg. 257) has a createElement method that takes a tag name as a parameter and returns
            that element. A text not is created using the <b>document.createTextNode()</b>method.   The Create thet text node use the 
            document.createTextNode() method. It takes a parameter, which is a string containing the text that goes in the node. An 
            <b>appendChild()</b>add another node (given as an argument) as a child node. It uses a flash object that calls the method, with
            flashText in the argument.<br>

            Now we have an element that contains the text we want. So the process to follow each time you want to
            create a new element with text content is this:<br>

                    
            <h2>Functions To Create Elements</h2>(Pg. 25)
            When we created our new list item element, all we specified was the type of tag and the text inside it. These will form the parameters
            of our function. The function will then perform the two steps we used to create the new element, and then return that elementYou can use 
            function to create elements. 
            
            <h2>Adding Elements to A Page</h2>
            Use the <b>appendChild() & insertBefore()</b> methods to move markup that already exists in the DOM as well. if you use multiple 
            inserts and appends, only the last one will have an effect. If an element is required to appear in several different places in the document,
            it would need to be cloned before each insertion.<br>
            
            <h2>Remove  & Replace Element From a Page</h2>
            An element can be removed from a page the <b>removeChild()</b> method that's called on the parent node using a single parameter. You can
            also replace elements on a page <b>replaceChild()</b> method replace one node with another. It’s called on the parent node and has two 
            parameters: the new node and the node that is to be replaced.<br>
            
            
            <h2>innerHTML</h2>
            The <b>innerHTML</b> property is also writable and can be used to place a chunk of HTML inside an element.It returns all the child elements
            of an element as a string of HTML. If an element contains lots of other elements, all the raw HTML is returned.<br>
            
            
            <h2>Live Collections</h2>
            Code w/in script tags will not execute. The <b>document.getElementsByClassName()</b> & <b>document.getElementsByTagName()</b> are live collections 
            that discourage for use due to performance reasons. You also need to be careful referring to elements by their index in a collection, as this can 
            change when markup is added or removed.<br>

            <h2>Updating CSS</h2>
            Every element node has a <b>style</b> property. This can be used to dynamically modify the presentation of any element on a web page. Any CSS 
            property names that are separated by dashes must be written in camelCase notation, so the dash  is removed and the next letter is capitalized 
            because dashes are not legal characters in property names. For ex the CSS proper <b>background-color</b> becomes <b>backgroundColor.</b> the 
            <b>bracbket</b> notation can also be used, meaning that CSS properties can be provided as a string and don't need the camelCase notation.<br> 
            
            
            <h2>The Disappearing Act</h2>
            The CSSproperty often employed is the <b>display</b> property can be used to make elements disappear and reappear on the page as needed.<br>
            
            
            
            <h2>Checking Style Properties</h2>
            The <b>getCommputerStyle()</b> fnction will retrieve all the style info. of an element that is given as a parameter. Browsers like Chrome do not allow 
            access to methods of a <b>CSSStyleDeclaration</b>obj such as <b>getPropertyCSSValue()</b>.<br>
        </section>

        <section id="events">
            <h2>Chapter7: Events</h2><br>
            <b>Eventlisterners</b> let out for any clicks on the page. Every time the page is clicked, a callback
            function will be called.
            So the program can continue processing the rest of the code while it's waiting for the click event to
            happen. The original way of dealing with
            browsers was to add an <b>Inline</b> event handlers attributes to markup. Ex in JS line 262. Howver, it's
            best to avoid using them.<br>

            Another me a program know when the event happens, and the program can then respond appropriately by using a
            non-blocking
            approach that usesevent listenersto listenthod is to use <b>old event handlers</b> that all node objs have,
            by assigning a function to be invoked
            when an even occurs, ex in JS line. This keep JS out of HTML. Whenever an event handler is triggered by an
            event, the callback function is called.
            This function is automatically passed an event object as a parameter that contains information about the
            event. The <b>type</b> propety returns the
            type of event that occurred, while the <b>target</b> property returns a reference to the node that fired the
            event.<br>

            You can locate a position of where a mougnt event occurs with the <b>clientX</b> & <b>clientY, </b>
            <b>screenX</b>, <b>screeY</b>, & the <b>pageX
            </b> &<b>pageY</b> properties all let you locate the number of pixel in various positions of the browser
            window & help you determine where the
            click happened.<br>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://babeljs.io/" title="Babel">Babel js.io</a></li>
            </ul>
            There are various types of events. You can view them at full list on the Events page of the Mozilla
            Developer Network. Other events are <b>mouse</b>
            events, <b>keyboard</b> events, <b>Modifier Keys</b> events, and <b>touch</b> events, which have various
            touch event properties. You can also remove
            an event w/ a <b>removeEventListener()</b>. Don't use anonymous functions as arguments to
            addEventListener(), if you want to remove it later.<br> Other
            elements have default behavior associated with certain events. The <b>preventDefault()</b> method does this
            inside a callback function of events.

            When you click on an element, you are actually clicking on all the elements it’s nested inside of this is an
            <b>event propagation</b>. Be careful when using
            <b>stopPropagation()</b> methods to end bubble phases, there can be <b>other</b> event listeners attached to
            the element. Event delegation can be used to
            attach an event listener to a parent element in order to capture events that are triggered by its child
            elements.<br>
