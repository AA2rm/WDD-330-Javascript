            <h1>Reading Notes</h1>
            <h2>Chapter5: Objects</h2><br>
            There are several ways to write programming lang.<br>
            <b>low-level programming language</b> is written in abstract code relating to the computer's archtecture.
            <b>high-level programming language</b> lanugauges that uses C, C++, or Java uses languages that are fast.
            This is suited for games and business software.
            <b>scripting lanugages</b> are high level languages, like JS, transformed into machine code at run time.
            Sometimes they are slow at compiling languages.<br>

            Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript & XML) allowed data from a server in the background & updated relevant part of
            the webpages w/o the need for a full page reload. Node.js allows server-side applications to be written in JS &
            for web apps to be written in JS. It has many app & JS libraries that doen't use the browser at all. It has 
            also allow for <b>Isomorphic JS</b> that lets the same JS code run on both the client or server side. <br>

            Implementations of JS vary from engine to engine caseing browser to behave differently when running JS.
            JavaScript and HTML5 technologies can be used to <b>develop browser extensions, Windows desktop widgets 
            and Chrome OS applications non-web-related applications, to add interactivity to PDF documents, interact 
            with a database, and even control  household appliances.</b><br>

            Note:download Node.js: The installer(Windows) or Node Version Manager.<br>
            <b>Validate Node</b>installation - node -v; it returns the node version.<br>
            <b>Vaidate REPL</b>type node; returns><br>
            <b>Exit REPL</b> hold the ctrl key & hit C twice.<br>

            The <b>E66 Console</b> lets you enter in JS commonad directly in the browser & see the results. Other
            options are Notepad++, Atom text editor, Brackets. There are also IDEs like MS VS, and online options are 
            CodePen, JSFiddle, & JS Bin.<br>

            Web pages have 3 layers HTML the markup, CSS design/presentation, & JS the interactive. These layers should
            be kept separate. JS is kept separate from HTML with a <b>script></b> tag. To link your JS to the HTML & 
            keep it unobtrusive use the best practice of writing a script tag for JS is in the footer below.<br>


            Use a<b>progressive enhancement</b> builds a web page from the ground up w/ a base level of functionality,
            then adds extra enhancements if they are available in the browser. <b>document.getElementById</b> function to 
            find the HTML element with the ID of btn, this is assigned to the btn variable.<br>

            <b>Syntactic sugar</b> allows an existing piece of code to be written in a niceer & more succinct way,
            making it backwardly compatble. <b>Transpilers</b>convert code from one version of JS into another.
            RESOURCE: Here's a transpiler Babel listed in the footer.<br>
            
            If you find that some code isn't working in your browser, you can add the following link into your HTML
            document. Note that this link needs to gobeforeany JavaScript that needs to be transpiled.<br>

            <code>
                <a href='https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js' title="Broken Script"></a><br>
            </code>

            You also have to change the type attribute to 'text/babel' in any links to JavaScript files. For example,
            the link to the JavaScript file in the example above would change to: <br>

            script type='text/babel' src='main.js'>script (add in the greater then & less than on the script tags).
            Every id attribute should be unique to just one element. If no element exists with the ID provided, null is 
            returned. The<b>getElementsByTagName()</b> will return a live node list of all the elements with the tag name that is provided as an argument. The
            <b>getElementsByClassName() </b>
            return a live node list of all elements that have the class name that is supplied as an argument.<br>

            <h2>Chapter 6: Document Obj Model</h2><br>
            The <b>Document Object Model, or DOM</b> for short, represents a HTML document as a network of connected
            nodes that form a tree-like structure. We can use JavaScript to access and modify different parts of a web page
            using a special built-in obj  called <b>document.</b><br>

            <b>Console Shortcuts</b><br>
            Pressing TAB will autocomplete any methods and should show you a list of possible methods. Pressing the UP
            arrow key will select the previous command entered. Both<b>document.querySelector()</b> & <b>document.querySelectorAll()</b> 
            are method that location the first element and all of the elements in a document. A <b>querySelector()</b> method 
            can be called onanyelement, rather than just document . For example, we can get a reference to the 'ul' element,
            & the lastChild property returns the last child of a node.<br>

            The <b>childNodes</b> property is a list of all the nodes that are children of the node concerned. The
            following example will return all the child nodes of the element with an id that your searhing for. The firstChild 
            property returns the first child of a node. Once you locate the reference to the text node, you can find the text 
            inside it useing the <b>nodeValue</b> method.<br>

            You can get and set attributes w/ various method that ca be used to <b>view, add, remove or modify</b> the
            value of these attributes. Use the <b>getAttribute()</b> or the <b>setAttributes</b> with these methods. The <b>.</b> 
            notation retrieves access to various attributes. The <b>setAttribute()</b> method lets you modify a class name. While 
            <b>classList</b> property is a list of all the classes an element has. It has a number of methods that make it easier 
            modify the class of an element. The <b>add</b> method is used to add a class to an element without overwriting any 
            classes that already exist. There are other methods sucha as <b>remove & toggle,</b><br>

            To add and extra class to an element for old browsers us an <b>addClass</b>element. Ex: The example is in JS<br>
            
            The document object has a <b>createElement()</b> method that takes a tag name as a parameter and returns
            that element. A text not is created using the <b>document.createTextNode()</b>method. An <b>appendChild()</b>add 
            another node (given as an argument) as a child node. It uses a flash object that calls the method, with flashText in 
            the argument.<br>

            Now we have a <li> element that contains the text we want. So the process to follow each time you want to create a 
            new element with text content is this:<br>

                Create the element node<br>
                Create the text node<br>
                Append the text node to the element node<br>
                const flash = document.createElement('li');
                flash.textContent = 'Flash';<br>

            You can use a function to cerate element (see JS file line 240), and use the <b>appendChild() &  insertBefore()</b> methods 
            to move markup that already exists in the DOM as well. if you use multiple inserts and appends, only the last one will have 
            an effect. If an element is required to appear in several different places in the document, it would need to be cloned before 
            each insertion. An element can be removed from a page using the <b>removeChild()</b> method that's called on the parent node 
            using a single parameter. You can also replace elements on a page<b>replaceChild()</b> method. The <b>innerHTML</b> property 
            is also writable and can be used to place a chunk of HTML inside an element. Code w/in script tags will not execute. The 
            <b>document.getElementsByClassName()</b> & <b>document.getElementsByTagName()</b> are live collections that discourage for use 
            due to performance reasons. You also need to be careful when referring to elements by their index in a collection, as this
            can change when markup is added or removed.<br>

            Every element node has a <b>style</b> property. This can be used to dynamically modify the presentation of any element on a web page. 
            Any CSS property names that are separated by dashes must be written in camelCase notation, so the dash is removed and the next 
            letter is capitalized because dashes are not legal characters in property names. For ex the CSS proper <b>background-color</b> becomes 
            <b>backgroundColor.</b> the <b>bracbket</b> notation can also be used, meaning that CSS properties can be provided as a string and
            don't need the camelCase notation. The CSSproperty often employed is the <b>display</b> property can be used to make elements 
            disappear and reappear on the page as needed. The <b>getCommputerStyle()</b> function will retrieve all the style info. of an element 
            that is given as a parameter. Browsers like Chrome do not allow access to methods of a <b>CSSStyleDeclaration</b> obj such as 
            <b>getPropertyCSSValue()</b>.<br>

            <h2>Chapter7: Events</h2><br>
            <b>Eventlisterners</b> let out for any clicks on the page. Every time the page is clicked, a callback function will be called. 
            So the program can continue processing the rest of the code while it's waiting for the click event to happen. The original way of dealing with
            browsers was to add an <b>Inline</b> event handlers attributes to markup. Ex in JS line 262. Howver, it's best to avoid using them.<br>

            Another me a program know when the event happens, and the program can then respond appropriately by using a non-blocking  
            approach that usesevent listenersto listenthod is to use <b>old event handlers</b> that all node objs have, by assigning a function to be invoked 
            when an even occurs, ex in JS line. This keep JS out of HTML. Whenever an event handler is triggered by an event, the callback function is called. 
            This function is automatically passed an event object as a parameter that contains information about the event. The <b>type</b> propety returns the 
            type of event that occurred, while the <b>target</b> property returns a reference to the node that fired the event.<br>

            You can locate a position of where a mougnt event occurs with the <b>clientX</b> & <b>clientY, </b> <b>screenX</b>, <b>screeY</b>, & the <b>pageX
            </b> &<b>pageY</b>  properties all let you locate the number of pixel in various positions of the browser window & help you determine where the 
            click happened.<br>

            There are various types of events. You can view them at full list on the Events page of the Mozilla Developer Network. Other events are <b>mouse</b> 
            events, <b>keyboard</b> events, <b>Modifier Keys</b> events, and <b>touch</b> events, which have various touch event properties. You can also remove 
            an event w/ a  <b>removeEventListener()</b>. Don't use anonymous functions as arguments to addEventListener(), if you want to remove it later.<br> Other
            elements  have default behavior associated with certain events. The <b>preventDefault()</b> method does this inside a callback function of events.

            When you click on an element, you are actually clicking on all the elements it’s nested inside of this is an <b>event propagation</b>. Be careful when using
            <b>stopPropagation()</b> methods to end bubble phases, there can be <b>other</b> event listeners attached to the element. Event delegation can be used to 
            attach an event listener to a parent element in order to capture events that are triggered by its child elements.
