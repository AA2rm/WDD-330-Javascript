CSS NOTES
To align menus, paragraphs, and list set the margin and padding to 0.
Using block on the display command expands the border to the links to the entire with of the page.
To rid your text links from the underline change your text-decoration command to none.
To hide the menu set the display to none and to show only the menu itself set the "nav ul li"  to 
first-child being the first link in the list. Don't forget this is it's own css command separate 
from the other "nave ul li" links.

JAVASCRIPT NOTES
Always link the JS after the footer and just before the </body> closing tag. Your HTML should be
before before & load befoe your JS.
There are 3 ways to declare a function in JS.
    Ex: 1 FUNCTION DECLARATION
    function toggleMenu() {
        document.querySelector('#navigation').classList.toggle('open');
    }
    Ex: 2 ARROW SYNTAX IS THE PREFERRED WAY
    const toggleMenu = () => {
    document.querySelector('#navigation').classList.toggle('open');
    }

    Ex: 3 FUNCTION EXPRESSION
    const toggleMenu = function() {
    document.querySelector('#navigation').classList.toggle('open');
    }

Two ways to call a function.

    Ex: 1 Make a change in the HTML
    <li><a href="#" id="menu" onclick="toggleMenu()">&equiv; Menu</a></li>

    Ex: 2 Make a change in JS
    <li><a href="#" id="menu">&equiv; Menu</a></li> OR document.querySelector('#menu');
